The code showcased here is from my personal projects, as I’m not permitted to share work from my employers due to ownership and confidentiality agreements. However, if you’re interested in learning more about my professional experiences, contributions, and the companies I’ve worked with, I invite you to visit my LinkedIn profile. There, you’ll find details about the projects I’ve contributed to, the skills I’ve honed, and how I’ve helped these companies achieve their goals while growing as a professional. https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiano-noleto-9b013529/
